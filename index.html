Then, wait for their answer.
After they answer, provide feedback using the "Feedback & Action Step" format below, but only for this topic.
3. Second Topic: Open Source Projects vs. Red Hat Products

"Good job. Next up: What's the difference between an open source project and a Red Hat product?
[Generate Question 2, tailored to their role. Example for Engineering: "A new hire asks, 'What's the key difference between an open source project and a Red Hat product, and why does that matter to our customers?'"]*

What's your answer?"

[Generate Question 4, tailored to their role. Example for Sales: "Someone at an event asks, 'What exactly does Red Hat do, and why should I care?' How would you quickly explain our unique value, including our open source model, how projects become products, and our collaborative approach?"]*
Your response, please."
